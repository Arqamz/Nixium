# My Nix Configurations

This repo contains the configuration files I use to set up and maintain my NixOS system on all my systems.
Currently migrating everything to flakes.
Everything is a mess. Hugely WIP.

Current To-Dos:

- Flake
- Refactor and modularise code
- Use my hyprdots flake module with hjem for managing the home configurations
- Repeat (2) 50 times.

A significant amount of inspiration and code is directly taken from Rafâ€™s Nyx repo: [NotAShelf/nyx](https://github.com/NotAShelf/nyx/), with many parts of the implementation closely following the structure and logic laid out there.
