# My Dotfiles

This repo contains the configuration files and scripts I use to set up and maintain my NixOS system on all my devices.
Currently working on writing my own home-config module. The documentation is incomplete and this codebase is a mess. Hugely WIP.

Current To-Dos (Jan 2025):
- Refactor and modularise code
- Move /home and use my hyprdots flake module for managing the configurations
- Implement wallust
- Implement hotswitching waybar/hyprland themes/styles
- Wallpaper changer menu (rofi probably)
- Setup a flake for configuration
- FDE
- Serve my own binary cache for faster build times
- NSpawn containers

## Overview

This repository is structured to provide a modular and easy-to-manage configuration for my NixOS setup. I use:
- [Hyprland](https://github.com/vaxerski/Hyprland) as my window manager
- [AGS bar](https://github.com/some/ags-bar-repo) as my status bar
- [Rofi](https://github.com/davatorium/rofi) as my application launcher
- [Waybar](https://github.com/Alexays/Waybar) as my status bar
- [Cava](https://github.com/karlstav/cava) as my audio visualizer

## Structure

The repository contains the following folders for configurations:

- `hypr`: Hyprland configurations
- `nixos`: NixOS configurations
- `rofi`: Rofi configurations
- `waybar`: Waybar configurations
- `cava`: Cava configurations

<!--
Each theme is set up in its own branch, and you can switch between them easily.

## Installation

1. **Clone the Repository:**
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/dotfiles.git
    cd dotfiles
    ```

2. **Symlink the Configurations:**
    ```sh
    ln -s $(pwd)/hypr ~/.config/hypr
    ln -s $(pwd)/nixos ~/.config/nixos
    ln -s $(pwd)/rofi ~/.config/rofi
    ln -s $(pwd)/waybar ~/.config/waybar
    ln -s $(pwd)/cava ~/.config/cava
    ```

3. **Install Dependencies:**
    Ensure you have Nix and the necessary packages installed. You can refer to my `shell.nix` file for a list of dependencies.

    ```sh
    nix-shell
    ```

## Usage

### Switching Themes

To switch between different themes, use the following commands:

```sh
git checkout <theme-branch>
```

For example:

```sh
git checkout theme-dark
```

<details>
<summary>Available Themes</summary>

- `theme-dark`
- `theme-light`
- `theme-nord`
- `theme-gruvbox`

</details>

After checking out the desired theme, reload your configurations:

```sh
hyprctl reload
waybar reload
rofi -restart
pkill cava && cava &
```

## Customization

Feel free to customize the configurations to fit your needs. Here are a few tips:

- **Hyprland Configuration:**
    Modify `hypr/hyprland.conf` to change window manager settings.
- **Waybar Modules:**
    Add or remove modules in `waybar/config` to display different information.
- **Rofi:**
    Customize the look and feel of Rofi by editing `rofi/config.rasi`.
- **Cava:**
    Change visualizer settings in `cava/config`.
